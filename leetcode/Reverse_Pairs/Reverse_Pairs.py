493. Reverse Pairs
hard
Given an array nums, we call (i, j) an important reverse pair if i < j and nums[i] > 2*nums[j].
You need to return the number of important reverse pairs in the given array.
Note:
1.The length of the given array will not exceed 50,000.
2.All the numbers in the input array are in the range of 32-bit integer.
